I believe this is a solid design.

1. Because each type of person is interfaced with the Person class. all people are people, but a student is not a teacher.
Polymorphism.

2. we could also apply this to Course. All courses are courses, but honors math is not math.
Polymorphism

3. Inheritance; each class inherits things from its super class. Attributes and methods.

4. Encapsulated due to having private attrbutes. no other class can access these.
