Overall this was a really fun experience to play with the trees.


Although im not sure how someone could debug and work on a tree problem without
excellent knowledge of a debugger. The debugger in pycharm is what made understanding
each step of the process clear and concise. The hardest part about this code
was in the project 2 when we needed to delete an existing element from the
tree if it exists. For this I implemented a new method called search that recursively
checks the tree for a match to delete.


this was a good challenge that made me think outside the box! enjoyed this one.
