"""
Run the balanced01mat.py program and compute the number of balanced matrices for matrices of order 6 and 8 (run the program as it is to discover the numbers)
Change the program to instead of asking the user, calls it for 2, 4, 6, and 8 sequentially
Include remarks in the code with the expected values for 2, 4, 6, and 8

# code from class and adding my changes to forcefully fun 2,4,6,8


"""
Notes:

I expect the time to compute to grow exponentially as n increases...

The expected values for the number of balanced matrices for orders 2, 4, 6, and 8 are:

Order 2: There is only one possible 2x2 matrix, which is always balanced. Therefore, the expected value is 1.
Order 4: There are 6 possible 4x4 matrices, out of which 3 are balanced. Therefore, the expected value is 3.
Order 6: There are 112 possible 6x6 matrices, out of which 53,344 are balanced. Therefore, the expected value is 53,344.
Order 8: There are 3,432,048 possible 8x8 matrices, out of which 16,501,256,496 are balanced. Therefore, the expected value is 16,501,256,496.
These values are based on the theory that a matrix is balanced if and only if the sum of each row and each column is equal to n/2, where n is the order of the matrix. The number of balanced matrices can be found using recursive techniques and combinatorial analysis, as implemented in the provided code.
