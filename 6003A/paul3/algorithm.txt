1. set up the board given a hard coded grid size and number of ships
2. create 10 empty arrays and replace all values with .
3. next iterate over all 10 arrays and randomly assign index with S
4. draw the current state of the board
5. while the game is not over
    So there are still ships present on the board
6. take in a row value from the command line
   if value is less than the range the grid has to offer throw value error and ask again
7. take in a col value from the command line
   if value is less than the range the grid has to offer throw value error and ask again
8.if both col and row values are valid
    check if that index is an S, if S replace with X and return hit
    check if value is already X, tell the user they already tried that!
    if the value is not S or X the user missed, replace index with O
9. Draw the board after the move is complete
10. loop back and check if the game is over after each move
    if the game is over end the loop else ask the user for more input
